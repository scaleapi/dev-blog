# Transfer Learning with Scale Rapid

This folder contains the code that was used for the Scale blog post,
"Easy Transfer Learning With Scale Rapid" ([link](https://scale.com/blog/transfer-learning-rapid)).
Everything you need is in `transfer_learning.ipynb`. Take a look!

Much of this code is repurposed from the Pytorch tutorial ["Torchvision Object Detection Finetuning Tutorial"](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torchvision_tutorial.html)
